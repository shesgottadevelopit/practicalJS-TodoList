// debugger gives you a deeper understanding of whats happening in your program

// the technique that allows you to pause your program at a certain point is called a breakpoint

// other ways to add breakpoints to your code
1) with debugger; 
2) without degugger; This is good because you don't have to edit your code and can identify and find multiple breakpoints
go to sources tab in developer tab
scroll until you see the script that you're running
go to the line you want to create a breakpoint at and click the line item

3) breaking on the DOM 
- inspect element
- right click on the code in the DOM and you'll get a list of optionos 
- go to Break on... and there are three options: 
a)subtree modifications: will break when any child element is modified: added removed or moved
b)attributes modifications: if an attribute on this element changes, it will break there
c)node removal: the program will break when an ordered list is removed


4) Breaking on events/listening to events
via Event Listener Breakpoints
