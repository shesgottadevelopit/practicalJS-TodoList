Arrays: 

Notes on creating an app:
// Outline requirements for an app, what it should be able to do. Break down the project into little pieces that individual team members can work on one at a time

V1 To-do app “requirements”:
// It should have a place to store todos; done // var todos = [“item1”, “item2”, “item3”]
// It should have a way to display todos; done //console.log(todos)
// It should have a way to add todos; done // variable.push(“item4”)
// It should have a way to change todos; done; accessed the array using indices and reassigned value // todos[0] = itemFirst
// It should have a way to delete todos; done // splice(x,y); x is the starting position, y is the number of array items you want to delete

-	Requirements give you focus so you work on one specific thing at a time
-	Requirements also help you test the application for functionality once the project is completed
