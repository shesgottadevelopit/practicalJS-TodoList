### Watch & Code: Practical JS Course

I started this course in May 2016 and completed about 98% of it before getting distracted.

As part of my 52 Weeks of Creating initiative, I'm revisiting it and planning to complete it. During my first iteration of the project, I wrote all of my notes as JS files. This time around I will convert everything to Markdown so that I can reference everything more easily.

I stored all my previous notes in the 2016 directory. My notes were in javascript files. Not as legible as markdown. My 2017 files are in the root of this repository.

Instead of using plnkr.co, I set up my own local environment for testing, creating an HTML file and linking each javascript version of the app within that HTML file and then testing in Chrome. This is my file structure:

Also, FYI - to create a blank new page in Chrome, just type `about:blank` in the URL bar
